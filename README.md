# TriviaApplication
Description

This project is an exercise in ajax and socket io. It is a simple multiplayer trivia game that uses ajax to retreive trivia data from an API we built locally, and and sockets to update the client's views.

Requirements

Node.js
express
redis server
mongodb
How to run application

Clone or Download the project.
Navigate to the projects directory.
Run the following commands: 'npm install' 'npm redis-server &' 'npm mongod --dbpath YOUR_PATH_TO_DATA_FOLDER &' 'npm start'
If redis and mongo servers are running, the application should be running on port 3000. eg. (localhost:3000)

Notes

There is a 'seed.js' file configured to run at start-up. This script populates some trivia data into the mongodb database.
